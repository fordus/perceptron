# âš› Perceptron 

This web tool allows you to experiment with a Perceptron model for binary classification tasks.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This application provides functionalities to generate synthetic data for training and testing a Perceptron. You can specify the size of the dataset, the desired operations on the data, and the percentage split for training and testing.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Data Generation**: Create synthetic datasets for training and testing.
- **Training**: Train a Perceptron model using the generated data.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the input data, desired outputs, and weights.
- **Validation**: Validate the Perceptron with new input data.

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. **Generate Data**: Fill in the required fields to generate synthetic data.
2. **Train Perceptron**: Provide training parameters such as epochs and learning rate, then click the "Train Perceptron" button.
3. **Input and Output**: View the generated data, desired outputs, and weights during and after training.
4. **Validation**: Use the input data validation section to test the trained Perceptron.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
